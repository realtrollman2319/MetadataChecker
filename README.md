Special thanks to Ster for helping me make this module!

# About
This module is for uScript2 for Unturned.
It's purpose is to add a extension that allows you to retrieve the metadata of a gun, gas can, night vision or a canteen.
Useful for storing the durability of a suppressor inside a gun, save files and more.
```
item [Class]:
	  +metadata            [get]      : array
	  
player [Class]:
    +giveItemMetadata(uInt16 itemId, string metadataString)
```

# Note:
When giving a player an item with metadata, it must be a comma seperated values, so it would be "196,9" for a full industrial gas can.
Same also applies for other guns.
